One day, the shadows will surround me
Someday, the days will come to end
Sometime, I'll have to face the real me
Somehow, I'll have to learn to bend

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I see clearly

[Chorus]
All these times, I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time, I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh
I apologize, whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh

[Verse 2]
One day, I'll face the hell inside me
Someday, I'll accept what I have done
Sometime, I'll leave the past behind me
For now I accept who I've become

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I see clearly

[Chorus]
All these times, I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time, I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, I apologize

[Bridge]
One day, the shadows will surround me

[Chorus]
All these times, I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time, I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, I apologize

[Outro]
Whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh, I apologize
Whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh, I apologize
Whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh, I apologize
Whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh, I apologize
I apologize
